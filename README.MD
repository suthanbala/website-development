# Rapid Web Prototyper

This framework is integrated with BrowserSync for responsive debugging, reloading and 
style injections.

The project currently have Bootstrap installed and configured. You may also install
additional packages.

The page injects `CSS` changes, reloads for `HTML/JS` changes.

## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```
    git clone https://github.com/suthanbala/website-development.git
    cd website-development
    npm install
```
    
## Development

To start developing, navigate to the project folder, then run
```
npm start
```
That command will spin up a server on the project folder. It will then watch for any 
`SASS` updates within `src/scss/..` and compile them into CSS and injects (no reloading)
them to the page.
